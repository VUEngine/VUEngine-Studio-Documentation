# Usage with other libraries

Although VUEngine Studio has been tailor-made to work with VUEngine, you can also use it with any other library. Sans all the VUEngine-specific features, of course.

In the following, as an example, it is described how to use VUEngine Studio with libgccvb.

1. Download <a href="https://github.com/VUEngine/libgccvb">libgccvb</a> from GitHub and unzip.
2. Change the VUEngine Core path setting `build.engine.core.path` to the location of libgccvb, e.g. "/Users/user/dev/libgccvb".
3. Profit! You can now build your libgccvb-based project (e.g. https://github.com/VUEngine/libgccvb-Barebone) through the usual means.
