Flash Carts View
================

...

NOTE: VUEngine Studio does not yet support automatic detection of ports, so for HyperFlash32 or HyperBoy carts, you have to manually create the `flashCarts.configs` setting from the settings menu and replace the %PORT% placeholder with the respective port name.

NOTE: On Windows, if your flash cart is not HID, like HyperFlash32 or HyperBoy, and it is not using WinUSB driver, you must install those before VUEngine Studio is able to detect the cart. The recommended way is to install the most recent version of [Zadig](https://zadig.akeo.ie/) and use it to change the driver of your flash cart to WinUSB, as shown in the screenshot below.
